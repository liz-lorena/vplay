I made this website for my 11-person ITI Capstone class start-up project. This website is one page and incorporates CSS animations, embedded content, and modal boxes. The product was an educational augmented reality gaming platform for young children with a physical toy subscription box component. I also helped create flowcharts for the app and some game designs.
